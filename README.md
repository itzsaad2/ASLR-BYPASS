## Background

Long, long ago, programs used to be loaded at constant addresses. Every time you ran a program, every function was located at the exact same virtual address. This made it quite easy for attackers to jump to known locations in program memory as part of their exploits, as they knew that specific functions would be located at specific addresses every time.

Enter Address-Space Layout Randomization, or ASLR. This mitigation randomizes the address of the program at runtime so that attackers canʼt simply know the actual addresses of payloads or gadgets. ASLR makes information leaks, or the ability to leak contents of the victimʼs memory, a necessity for most memory corruption exploits. We will explore several means of creating information leaks using, you guessed it, microarchitectural side channels.

Luckily for us attackers, ASLR in Linux is applied not at the byte or word level, but at a page granularity. This means that on our `x86_64`  machines `4KB` pages, the lower `12` bits of an address will always stay the same (as only the virtual page number changes from run to run).

ASLR is applied as a random constant, letʼs call it delta, added to every virtual page number in the programʼs address space. People usually use different delta values for different parts of memory. (So the stack gets its own delta, the heap gets its own delta, and the program code gets its own delta).

This means that distances are preserved under ASLR – Leaking just one pointer to a given structure is typically sufficient to find anything in the structure. For example, if my program binary has two methods- `MethodA` and `MethodB`, knowing the address of `MethodA` tells me where to find `MethodB`. The relative distance between `MethodA` and `MethodB` is unchanged under ASLR. The trick is finding the address of `MethodA` in the first place!

We declare ASLR defeated if we can leak just a single address.

In this assignment, we will explore ASLR from both software and hardware perspective and investigate techniques that can be used to reveal the address space layout and use this to construct code-reuse attacks.

## Getting Started

This assignment will be done on the UTM CS lab machines (`dh2010pcXX`, `dh2020pcXX`, and `dh2026pcXX`), on which we have already tested this assignment. (If you are unable to get access, please reach out on Piazza).

Please clone the starter code for this assignment from the provided github repository.

### Assignment Codebase

This assignment is divided into three distinct modules - parts 1, 2, and 3. The code for each is contained within the `part1`, `part2`, and `part3` folders respectively.

In Part 1, you will be modifying the files `part1A.c`, `part1B.c`, and `part1C.c`. You should not modify `main.c`.

In Part 2, you will be modifying `part2A.c` and `part2B.c`. The vulnerable method you will be exploiting is defined in `main.c`. The win and `call_me_maybe` methods are also defined in `main.c`. The gadgets to use for your ROP chain are defined in `gadgets.s`. You should not modify `main.c`.

In Part 3, you will be modifying `part3.c`. Just like in Part 2, `call_me_maybe` and vulnerable are defined in `main.c`. The gadgets you will be using are in `gadgets.o` (run make to get it), and are the same as the gadgets in `part2/gadgets.s`. You should not modify `main.c`.

For all three parts, you will build the assignment by running make. Each subpart is a binary identified simply by the part letter. For example, Part 2 will contain: 
`a  b  build  gadgets.s  main.c  Makefile  part2A.c  part2B.c`.

`a` and `b` are your built programs. `a` is your solution for Part 2A and `b` is your solution for Part 2B). You can run them with `./a` or `./b`.

In Part 3, the binary is simply called `part3`, as there is only one subsection for Part 3.

Hereʼs a list of all files we will consider while grading:
```
- part1/part1A.c
- part1/part1B.c
- part1/part1C.c
- part2/part2A.c
- part2/part2B.c
- part3/part3.c
```
You are free to include whatever standard library header files youʼd like anywhere in the assignment. If you accidentally include something that uses an illegal syscall, youʼll see the `seccomp-filter` complain (See the section about the ASLR assignment jail).

### Discussion Questions

Submit your answers as a `report.pdf` inside your `submission.zip` on markus.

### Automated Checking

We provide a check script that can tell you whether your code was correct or not.

Below are the options available with the check utility:

```
 % ./check.py -h usage: check.py [-h] part 

Check your lab code 

positional arguments:
  part        Which part to check? 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, or 3? 

optional arguments:
 -h, --help show this help message and exit
```

You can check a specific part by specifying the part to check:

```
 % ./check.py 1a
make: Nothing to be done for 'all'. Checking part 1A...
100%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 1000/1000 [00:03<00:00, 251.72it/s]
You passed 1000 of 1000 runs (100.0%) Success! Good job 

Your score is 20 / 20
You scored 100.0% for this part!
```
You can also check the entire lab by running `./check,py all`.  At the end, the autograder will tell you your grade. In the above example, we scored 100% for Part 1A.

### Jailing
During these exercises, you will be operating inside of a `chroot` and `seccomp-filter` jail. This jail will prevent your code from performing most system calls and file accesses, so you canʼt read `/proc/self/pagemap` to determine where our mystery page is.

Hereʼs the system calls that we allow your code to execute:
* `write` - Write to an already open file descriptor.
* `access` - See Part1A.
* `close:` - Close a file descriptor.
* `exit / exit_group` - Quit the program
* `fstat` - Needed by `printf`

If your code tries to access an illegal syscall, youʼll see the following message:
```
% ./part1A
zsh: invalid system call  ./part1A
```
You can use `strace` to trace which system calls your program made.

```
 % strace ./part1A
... 

execve(NULL, NULL, NULL)                = ?
+++ killed by SIGSYS +++
zsh: invalid system call  strace ./part1A
```
In this example, the program was terminated because it ran `execve`.

You should not have to worry about the filter, as it is only there to prevent you from bypassing the assignment in a trivial manner, and to increase the immersion of the assignment experience.

If youʼre curious about how the seccomp filter works, check out `setup_jail` in `main.c` of Part 1 or 3 (Part 2 doesnʼt use a jail).

## Part 1: Breaking ASLR

In this part we will explore different ways to break ASLR – one simple method operating at the ISA level (1a), and another relying on a microarchitectural attack (1b). Finally, there is an optional bonus component (c) where you can do this using a Spectre attack (1c - optional). 

In all three parts, you will be tasked with locating a single page of code within a given range. Your code will be given a lower and upper bound to scan. You will scan this range using three different techniques, and return the correct page as the return value of your function.

Before your code runs, we will mmap a random page into memory at a random location. We will then pass two bounds to your code to scan for this random page. Everywhere inside of these bounds except for the single page to find will be unmapped (no entry in the page table).

Your code will need to locate the random page.
![Memory Layout](/images/mem_layout.png)

Your code will operate as follows:

```
// Your code for each exercise in Part 1: 

uint64_t find_address(uint64_t low, uint64_t high) {
  for (uint64_t addr = low; addr < high; addr += PAGE_SIZE) { 

     // The implementation of is_the_page_mapped will be
     // different for Parts 1A, 1B, and 1C.
     if (is_the_page_mapped(addr)) { 
     	return addr;
     } 

  }

  return NULL;
}
```

For now, all you need to do is locate the page. In later parts, weʼll need the location of this page for conducting realistic code reuse attacks in Part 3!

## Part 1A: Egghunter (20%)

Egghunters are a technique commonly used in binary exploitation where you have limited code execution and are trying to find a larger payload to execute. For example, you may be able to execute a small (on the order of 64 bytes) amount of code. You have also injected a larger code payload into the program but donʼt know where it is located. An “egg hunter” is a small chunk of code that is used to find the larger chunk of code.

In this assignment, we will be writing an egg hunter in C to scan for a page in memory. We wonʼt be looking for a particular value in memory (as most egg hunters do) – we will just look for the mapped page.

You may be wondering what the mechanism for egg hunting actually is. Typically, it is the kernel itself! To see what we mean by this, check out this exerpt from the man page for the [access](https://web.archive.org/web/20230519161730/https:/man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/access.2.html) syscall.

```
ERRORS

	EACCES The requested access would be denied to the file, or
	       search permission is denied for one of the directories in
	       the path prefix of pathname.  (See also
	       path_resolution(7).) 

	EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address space.
```

The `access` syscall takes a path name and a mode and returns whether the file can be accessed by our current process. It has the following declaration.

`int access(const char *pathname, int mode);`


We provide as input to `access` a pointer to a string, and it will do something with it (what it does, we donʼt care). We wonʼt be using access
 for its intended purpose- we will use it as an oracle for determining if an address is mapped into our address space.

Notice how `access` will return `EACCES` if the string points to valid memory (but describes an invalid file) and `EFAULT` if the string doesnt belong to our address space. We can pass every address in the region to  `access` and if it returns anything but `EFAULT` we know that the add ress is mapped.

![Key Idea](/images/key-idea-1.png)

Your code will need to run in 1 second or less and should produce the correct answer 100% of the time. (If it ever gets the answer wrong, you will receive a 0 for this part).

![Exercise, Discussion Section & Hint](/images/exercise-1-1.png)

## Part 1B: The prefetch Instruction (40%)

In this part, we will be implementing the Prefetch attack from _Prefetch Side-Channel Attacks_ [1].

The [`prefetch`](https://web.archive.org/web/20230826084530/https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_252.html) instruction provides a hint to the prefetcher to load a particular line into the cache. This instruction performs absolutely 0 access control checks. We will use the `prefetch` instruction to try and load every address into the cache. In particular, we will use the “Translation-Level Oracle” technique (described in their Section 3.2 of the [Prefetch Side-Channels paper](https://gruss.cc/files/prefetch.pdf)) to locate our hidden page.

The prefetch instruction will try to translate the given virtual address into a physical address and load it into the cache hierarchy. If the address is unmapped, it will require a full page table walk (which takes many cycles!). If the page is already present in the cache hierarchy, prefetch will stop early.

To be more precise, when we use prefetch on an address, if the corresponding page is unmapped, the page table entry will not appear in any micro architectural structures. So the processor ends up doing the following operations:
1.  TLB lookup (miss)
2. Page cache lookup (miss)
3.  Page table walk (traverse the page table tree)
4.  Find the entry is invalid
5.  Done

If the page is mapped and if it has been accessed before, the corresponding page table entry could exist in one or multiple of these structures and prefetch will stop much earlier.

By timing how long prefetch takes to run, we can determine whether the given address was present or not. If prefetch is slow, that means a full page table walk occurred, and therefore the address was not mapped. If it is fast, then the address is likely to have already existed in the cache hierarchy, and so it is likely to be our address.

![Key Idea 2](/images/key-idea-2.png)

Timing the prefetch instruction is a little tricky due to CPU synchronization. We recommend you follow the instruction sequence approach used by the paper authors:

```
mfence
rdtscp
cpuid
prefetch
cpuid
rdtscp
mfence
```
While doing this exercise, you may find referring to the [source code](https:/github.com/IAIK/prefetch/blob/master/addrspace/addrspace.c) helpful [3]. Additionally, the [GNU manual](https:/gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html) on inline assembly is quite handy [9]. 

For causing a `prefetch` instruction, you can either try the builtin `_mm_prefetch(address,_MM_HINT_T2)` function, or you can use the following wrapper (taken from the IAIK repo [3]):

```
void prefetch(void* p)
{ 
  asm volatile ("prefetchnta (%0)" : : "r" (p));
  asm volatile ("prefetcht2 (%0)" : : "r" (p));
}
```

Your code will need to run in 5 seconds or less and should produce the correct result 90% of the time or better.


![Exercise 1.3](/images/exercise-1-3.png)

## Part 1C: Speculative Probing (Bonus 10%)

![Warning](/images/warning-1.png)

Having access to the prefetch instruction makes things too easy. Additionally, not all architectures have such a convenient instruction for performing attacks. **Speculative Probing** [2] is a more general technique that has been shown to work on many architectures. We will be implementing a modified version of the Code Region Probing attack described in Section 5.1 of the Speculative Probing paper.

To conduct a speculative probing attack, you will write and exploit your _own_ spectre gadget! Hereʼs an overview of how it works.

First, you will write your own Spectre gadget. Below is pseudocode you can use as a guide for your speculative probing gadget. Write this as a C function in `part1C.c`.

```
def speculative_probing_gadget(condition, guess, controlled_memory):
 if condition: 

 # Access 1: Derefence the "guess" address (if it is mapped). 

 idx = load(guess)
 # If guess was not mapped, we will crash here.
 # Hopefully all crashes happen under speculation so the program doesn't crash! 
 
 # Access 2: Modify some controlled memory at an index dependent on the first load. 
 # This only happens if the first load didn't crash, since the index is
 # a function of the contents of the first load.
 controlled_memory[idx] += 1
```

Youʼll notice that this gadget operates slightly different from typical Spectre gadgets. Here, we donʼt actually care about the value of the first load. Instead, we want to determine whether or not the load was _successful_.

There are two cases for our guess address: either our current guess is correct, or it isnʼt. If we have the right address, we can read freely from it without any issues. However, if it isnʼt mapped, reading from it will cause a page fault exception (that we will observe as a segfault). Just one segfault will crash the whole program.

So instead, letʼs have the crashes run under speculation, and use a side channel to learn whether or not a crash happened.

![Key Idea 3](/images/key-idea-3.png)

After creating the gadget, you will need to control it. You can use the following as a high-level overview of a potential attack:

1. Allocate a chunk of memory to use.
2. Train the branch predictor for your `speculative_probing_gadget`.
3. Try an address with `speculative_probing_gadget`.
4. Learn whether or not a load occurred with time_access to your controlled memory.

There are a few engineering problems to solve. Notably, the contents of probed memory could be anything. How do you know idx's value was? Is there a way to make our attack access `controlled_memory` the same way regardless of way `idx` was?

![Exercise 1.5](/images/exercise-1-5.png)

We will run your code 10 times and it should work at least once. We will kill each job after 2 minutes.
•  You completely control the Spectre code, so you can write it any way you like.
•  You may find it beneficial to write and test a Spectre gadget independently.
•  Make sure that both memory accesses happen speculatively so that you donʼt crash the program!
•  Donʼt forget you can `clflush` any address youʼd like.

### Part 1 Checklist

Before you move on to Part 2, make sure that youʼve:
* Completed the code for Exercises 1-1 and 1-3 (and 1-5 if youʼre doing the extra credit).
* Checked your code with the check script and made sure it passes.
* Answered Discussion Questions 1-2 and 1-4.

## Part 2: Code Reuse Attacks

In this part, we will explore what the consequences are for breaking ASLR. We will also get some practice constructing realistic code reuse attacks that attackers might use in the real world against vulnerable programs.

We will be exploiting a category of bugs known as **buffer overflows**. In a buffer overflow, the program reads more information than can fit into a particular buffer, overwriting memory past the end of the buffer.

### Buffer Overflows

The most basic form of a buffer overflow is the **stack buffer overflow**.

```
/*
 * vulnerable
 * This method is vulnerable to a buffer overflow
 */ 

void vulnerable(char *your_string) {
 // Allocate 16 bytes on the stack 
 char stackbuf[0x10]; 

 // Copy the attacker-controlled input into 'stackbuf'
 strcpy(stackbuf, your_string);
}
```

If `your_string` is larger than 16 bytes, then whatever is on the stack below `stackbuf` will be overwritten. 

So what's on the stack?

When a function is called, the return address is pushed to the stack. The return address is the next line of code that will be executed. Letʼs take a look at a hypothetical piece of assembly:
```
0x100: call vulnerable
0x101: nop
```
Immediately after `call vulnerable` the next instruction to execute (in this case `0x101`) will be pushed to the stack. When `vulnerable` is done, it will execute `ret` which will pop the return address of the stack and jump to it.

Lets look at the disassembly of `vulnerable` to find out more:

```
vulnerable:

    # rdi contains 'your_string' 

    # First, setup the stack frame for vulnerable 
1   push   rbp
2   mov    rbp,rsp 

    # Create some space for stackbuf on the stack 
3   sub    rsp,0x10 

    # Put 'your_string' into rsi (argument 2) 
4   mov rsi,rdi

    # Put 'stackbuf' into rdi (argument 1) 
5   lea    rax,[rbp-0x10]
6   mov    rdi,rax 

    # Call strcpy(stackbuf, your_string) 
7   call strcpy

    # Teardown our stack frame 
8   mov rsp, rbp
9   pop rbp
    
    # Return from vulnerable (this is basically pop rip) 
10  ret
```
Immediately upon entry to `vulnerable` (right before line `1), the stack will look like this:
```
Towards 0x0000000000000000 

 Stack Growth
       /|\ 

        |

	|
+---------------+ 

|     0x101     | <- Return address!
+---------------+ 

Towards 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
```
Next, the `rbp` register is pushed, and some more space is made for `stackbuf`. So after line 3, the stack will look like this:
```
Towards 0x0000000000000000 

 Stack Growth
       /|\ 

        |

        |
+---------------+ 

|     ?????     | <- Space for stackbuf
+---------------+
|    Old RBP    | <- Saved RBP
+---------------+ 

|     0x101     | <- Return address!
+---------------+

Towards 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
```

Note that `stackbuf` sits *above* the return address on the stack. If we put more information into `your_string` than can fit into `stackbuf`, we will continue writing *down* the stack, and overwrite the return address.

That means we can change what happens when `vulnerable` concludes executing, effectively redirecting control flow in a way we desire!

Of course, in order to actually do this, we will need to know where the code we want to run is located. This is where ASLR bypasses come in handy. By breaking the address randomization of a program, we can reveal where program instructions are located, and jump to them by overwriting return addresses (or any function pointers in a program).

You can read [Stack Smashing in the 21st Century](https:/thesquareplanet.com/blog/smashing-the-stack-21st-century/) for more background on buffer overflows.


## Part 2A: ret2win (10%)

In this activity we will perform a `ret2win` attack. In a `ret2win` attack, the attacker replaces the return address with the address of a `win` method that, when called, does everything the attacker wants. The attacker does not need to control any arguments passed to `win` – we only care that `win` gets executed.

The vulnerable method for this assignment operates as follows:

```
void vulnerable(char *your_string) {
 // Allocate 16 bytes on the stack
 char stackbuf[16]; 

 // Copy the user input to the stack: 
 strcpy(stackbuf, your_string);
}
```

Feel free to read the source code of `vulnerable` for more info on how the stack works.

For now, you can get the `win` address manually (without needing to use your ASLR bypass techniques in Part 1) as follows:

```
// Cast win to a function pointer and then to a 64 bit int 
uint64_t win_address = (uint64_t)&win;
``` 

After we run your code, we will print the resulting stack frame to the console so you can see how your attack worked. In this example, Iʼve set 
 `your_string` to 16 Aʼs ('`A' == 0x41`) followed by a newline (`'\n'`). So we see 16 `0x41`s repeated on the stack. The newline does not appear as our version of `strcpy` doesn't copy the ending new line byte. 

This is what the stack looks like now:
 
```
      +-----------------------------------------+ 

0x00: | 0x00007FFE055628B0 = 0x4141414141414141 | <- stackbuf starts here
      +-----------------------------------------+ 

0x01: | 0x00007FFE055628B8 = 0x4141414141414141 |
      +-----------------------------------------+ 

0x02: | 0x00007FFE055628C0 = 0x00007FFE05562CE0 | <- Saved RBP
      +-----------------------------------------+ 

0x03: | 0x00007FFE055628C8 = 0x000055FEF9B4E91A | <- Return address!
      +-----------------------------------------+
 ```

We provide you some sample code to fill in the string you pass to `vulnerable`. For your convenience, we treat your “string” as an array of 64-bit integers. This way you can directly write to a specific slot on the stack by indexing the provided array. For example, to set the saved RBP position (index 2), you can use `your_string[2] = 0x0123456789abcdef`.

**Note on strcpy:** To allow `NULL` characters into your buffer, we use a different definition of `strcpy` than the libc one. Our `strcpy` allows `NULL` characters, but stops at newlines (`0x0A`, or `'\n'`). This is to mirror the behavior of `gets`, which is commonly used in CTF stack overflow problems.

**Note on rbp:** The base pointer `rbp` is reset upon entry to a C function (see line 2 of the vulnerable disassembly above). So you can set it to whatever you like during your overflow and it wonʼt make a difference (you will need to overwrite `rbp` to change the return address).

![Exercise 2.1](/images/exercise-2-1.png)

It is okay if your code segfaults on occasion for Part 2A (it doesnt have to work every time, so long as it works most of the time). This is because sometimes ASLR gives an address that has a new line in it, which means your overflow will stop early.

## Part 2B: Return Oriented Programming (ROP) (20%)

In this part, we will perform a return oriented programming attack, or ROP. ROP is a technique devised to counteract data execution prevention (otherwise known as W^X), which is a security feature introduced to protect against simply writing your own code into the stack and jumping to it. DEP and ASLR are the foundation of all modern exploit mitigations. Just like how ASLR can be sidestepped with an information leak, DEP can be defeated by ROP.

The idea behind ROP is to construct a sequence of code by combining tiny “gadgets” together into a larger chain. ROP looks a lot like `ret2win`, except we add more things to the stack than just overwriting a single return address. Instead, we construct a chain of return addresses that are executed one after the other.

Lets take a look at two example ROP gadgets:
```
gadget_1:
    pop rdi 
    ret

gadget_2:
    pop rsi 
    ret
```

The above sequences of code will pop the top value off the stack into `rdi` or `rsi`, and then return to the next address.

We can combine them as follows to gain control of `rdi` and `rsi` by writing the following to the stack:

```
+---------------+
|  OVERWRITTEN  | <- Space for stackbuf
+---------------+
|  OVERWRITTEN  | <- Saved RBP
+---------------+
|    gadget_1   | <- Return address
+---------------+
| New rdi Value |
+---------------+
|    gadget_2   |
+---------------+
| New rsi Value |
+---------------+
| Next gadget...|
+---------------+
```

We can encode desired values for  `rdi` and `rsi` on to the stack alongside our return addresses. Then, by carefully controlling where code execution goes, we can make the gadgets perform arbitrary computation.

In fact, it has been shown that [ROP is Turing Complete](https:/github.com/pakt/ropc) for sufficiently large programs.

![Key Idea 4](/images/key-idea-4.png)

For this problem, you will need to combine ROP gadgets to cause `call_me_maybe` to return the flag. You will use the same buffer overflow as we used in Part 2A, and you can get the address of a given gadget the same way we got the address of the `win` function.

The gadgets are defined in `gadget.s`. `call_me_maybe` is defined below:

```
void call_me_maybe(uint64_t rdi, uint64_t rsi, uint64_t rdx) {
    if ((rdi & 0x02) != 0) { 
	if (rsi == 2 * rdi) {
	   if (rdx == 1337) { 
	      printf("UofT{flag_goes_here}\n"); 
	      exit(0); 
	   }
	}
    }

    printf("Incorrect arguments!\n");
    printf("You did call_me_maybe(0x%lX, 0x%lX, 0x%lX);\n", rdi, rsi, rdx);
    exit(-1); 
}
```

![Exercise 2.2](/images/exercise-2-2.png)

It is okay if your code segfaults on occasion for Part2B (it doesnt have to work every time so long as it works most of the time). This is because sometimes ASLR gives an address that has a new line in it, which means your overflow will stop early. 

### Debugging

If you are experiencing crashes and donʼt know why, you can use GDB to help figure out where your exploit is going wrong.

Here's an example of running GDB on a non-working Part 2B (`./b`):

```

You can inspect the state of your registers at the crash by running `info registers`:

```
(gdb) info registers
rax            0x4141414141 280267669825
rbx            0x0  0
rcx            0x0  0
...
rip            0xffffffffffffffff       0xffffffffffffffff
```

`rip` will contain the address your code tried to execute (in this case, `0xffffffffffffffff`), and the rest of the registers will show what your ROP chain managed to store into them before crashing. Additionally, `call_me_maybe` will report the arguments you called it with if you got them wrong. The listing above shows the register values both in hex and “decoded” (interpreted as whatever GDB thinks the value is). This sometimes will still be hex, decimal, or it could be a string.

Below is a “cheat-sheet” of the important commands to know in gdb:

#### GDB Cheat Sheet 
* `si` - Step over a single instruction.
* `bt` - Show a stack backtrace (during buffer overflows this will get corrupted as we change the stack).
* `b` - Set a breakpoint at a location (an example of this will be given later).
* `c` - Continue until you hit a breakpoint.
* `disas` - Disassemble a specific function
* `x` - Examine memory (an example of this will be given later). 

Here is an example GDB workflow that might be useful for debugging your attack code.

```
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
(gdb) b main.c:235
Breakpoint 2 at 0xa09: file main.c, line 235.
(gdb) run 

...
Breakpoint 2, vulnerable (your_string=0x7fffffffdfb0 "\277") at main.c:235
235 }
(gdb)
```

First, I set the disassembly flavor to `intel` syntax (which is easier to read). Then, I set a breakpoint in `main.c` on the line `235`, which is the last line of `vulnerable` (it is the line with the closing `}` on it - this number may be different for your `main.c`). Then, I run the program and stop on the breakpoint.

```
(gdb) x/3i $rip
=> 0x555555554a09 <vulnerable+337>: nop 
   0x555555554a0a <vulnerable+338>: leave
   0x555555554a0b <vulnerable+339>: ret
```

I use the examine memory command as `x/3i`. This means print the next 3 instructions from a given address. I use the register `rip` (specified with a `$` before it) as the location to print from. This tells us what instructions the program will run next. The `=>` arrow points to the very next instruction to execute.

```
(gdb) si
(gdb) x/2i $rip
=> 0x555555554a0a <vulnerable+338>: leave 
   0x555555554a0b <vulnerable+339>: ret
```
Using the `si` command I can step into the program, and when I print the next few instructions you'll see that we  have moved forward by one. We can define a hook to print this automatically for us with the following:

```
(gdb) define hook-stop
Type commands for definition of "hook-stop".
End with a line saying just "end".
>x/3i $rip
>end
(gdb)
```

Now every time we step, we will automatically see the next few instructions. Lets keep stepping until we hit the `ret`.

```
(gdb) si
=> 0x555555554a0b <vulnerable+339>: ret
...
(gdb) si
=> 0x555555554ae5 <gadget1>:    pop    rax 
   0x555555554ae6 <gadget1+1>:  ret 

 ...
0x0000555555554ae5 in gadget1 ()
(gdb)
```

You can see that we landed on `gadget1`, which was the first gadget in my ROP sequence! Let's step one more time and see what gets loaded into `rax`.

```
(gdb) si
=> 0x555555554ade <gadget1+1>:  ret 
...
(gdb) p/x $rax
$1 = 0x4141414141
```

I can print the value of `rax` using `p/x $rax` (or `info registers` if I want to see all the registers). Here we can see that `rax` was loaded with `0x41414141` (the string `“AAAA”`). Letʼs step one more time and see what happens next.

```
(gdb) si
=> 0xffffffffffffffff:  Error while running hook_stop:
Cannot access memory at address 0xffffffffffffffff
0xffffffffffffffff in ?? ()
```

Looks like this is where the crash comes from! So, from using GDB, I was able to determine that my load of `rax` with `gadget1` is successful, but the gadget after that is not correctly filled in.

You can quit `gdb` with quit (or just `q`).

You can learn more about GDB [here](https:/www.sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/).


### Stack Alignment

If your code seems like it should work (the correct arguments are passed to `call_me_maybe`, yet your program keeps crashing), it is likely due to a problem called stack alignment.

The System V C ABI requires that the stack is 16 byte aligned when entering a function. When we mess about with the stack in a buffer overflow attack, we can sometimes change that alignment. There is a simple solution here - use a single `ret` gadget to realign the stack to 16 bytes. You can get the address of a `ret` instruction from `objdump` (use the `ret` instruction from any of the 6 provided gadgets).

### Part 2 Checklist

Before you move on to Part 3, make sure that you have:

* Completed the code for Exercises 2-1 and 2-2.
* Checked your code with the check script and made sure it passes.


## Part 3: Putting it All Together (10%)

We are now going to combine the ASLR bypasses in Part 1 with the ROP chain you wrote in Part 2.

The random page from Part 1 will contain the same sequence of ROP gadgets that you had access to in Part 2B. Additionally, it will be marked executable so that it can be executed if you jump to it.


### Dumping the gadgets

The hidden page from Part 1 will be filled with the code from the `gadgets.o` file (which is included in the part3 folder). Dump the contents of `gadgets.o` with the following:

```
objdump -d gadgets.o -M intel
```

Objdump will report something like the following:
```
Disassembly of section .text: 

0000000000000000 <gadget1>:
   0:   5f       pop rdi
   1:   c3 		 ret
  ...

0000000000000010 <gadget2>:
  10:   5e       pop rsi
  11:   c3		 ret
  ```
The line `0000000000000000 <gadget1>` tells you the offset of `gadget1` will be located at `hidden_page (0x0000)` and `gadget2` will be at `hidden_page (0x0010)` (where `hidden_page` is a `uint8_t *` that points to the page your Part 1 code found).

As ASLR slides everything together by applying a constant offset, `gadget2` will always be `0x10` bytes after `gadget1`, no matter where ASLR places them.
